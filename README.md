# Application From

This app can only be ran locally, get the [swagger schema (yaml)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cf92anqoqlg6p19/Application%20Form.yaml?dl=0) and mock the api end using [prism](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/prism/674b27b261c3c-overview)

replace the `URL` in `constants.ts` folder with url returned from `prism mock` and hopefully every thing should work perfectly.
